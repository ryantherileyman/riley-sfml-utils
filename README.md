# Riley SFML Utilities Library
Provides various features for the SFML library (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).

[SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php) is distributed under the zlib/png license.

## r3-SfmlTextUtils
The r3-SfmlTextUtils library contains additional features for rendering large blocks of text in a graphics context.

See the FontFamilyExample for usage on the FontFamily class.  This provides a way of grouping together a base font, with optional bold, italic, and bold-italic variations.  The `createTextWithStyle` method chooses the most appropriate font and style properties for an SFML Text object.

See the MultilineTextExample for usage on the MultilineTypesettingBlock class.  This provides a way of wrapping a large string into separate lines (the `splitIntoLines` method), and anchoring large blocks of text with both horizontal and vertical alignment options (the `createAlignedTextList` method).
